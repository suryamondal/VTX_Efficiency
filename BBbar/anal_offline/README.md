# Offline analysis
Makes a number of plots out of the NTuples generated by the steering files.

## Compiling
Compile with `./compile.py`. ROOT is required, and it must be a version

If something doesn't work, use `./clean.sh` and recompile from scratch.

## Using
Simply run `./ana path/to/ntuple.root pisoft mu ...[]`.
B0 is calculated by default, no need to add.
It will produce a PDF/ROOT files named like the ntuple plus suffixes;
existing PDFs will be overwritten.
