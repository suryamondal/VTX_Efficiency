# Offline analysis
Makes a number of plots out of the NTuples generated by the steering files.

## Compiling
Compile with `./compile.py`. ROOT is required, and it must be a version
compiled with the RDataFrame (i.e. not the one used for basf2 on CVMFS/KEKCC).

If something doesn't work, use `./clean.sh` and recompile from scratch.

## Using
Simply run `./ana path/to/ntuple.root`. It will produce a lot of PDF files
named like the ntuple plus suffixes; existing PDFs will be overwritten.

## Efficiency comparison
After running `./ana`, a rootfile `*_efficiency.root` is generated, with the
efficiency histograms produced. Histograms from different ntuples can be
compared with
```
./EfficiencyComparison.py TITLE1 file1.root TITLE2 file2.root [...]
```
This will output a `effcomp.pdf` file in the same directory as the first file.
