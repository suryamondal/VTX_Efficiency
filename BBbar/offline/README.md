# Offline analysis
Makes a number of plots out of the NTuples generated by the steering files.

## Compiling
Compile with `./compile.py`. ROOT is required, and it must be a version
compiled with the RDataFrame (i.e. not the one used for basf2 on CVMFS/KEKCC).

If something doesn't work, use `./clean.sh` and recompile from scratch.

## Using
Simply run `./ana path/to/ntuple.root`. It will produce a lot of PDF files
named like the ntuple plus suffixes; existing PDFs will be overwritten.
