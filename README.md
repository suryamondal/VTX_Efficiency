# VTX Physics Benchmark
Repository for studies of the proposed upgraded VTX. Includes efficiency and
resolution studies using events with `D0`s that decay either in `K pi` or in
`K 3pi`.

In `ccbar/` there are macros, scripts, etc. for generating and analysing
`D*+ -> D0 pi+` events generated from the continuum.

In `BBbar/` there are macros, scripts, etc. for generating and analysing
`Upsilon(4S) -> B+ B-` events. Since charged B mesons decay in channels with at
least one `D0` about 90% of the time, there is no need to change their decay
table.
